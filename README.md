<h2>Goals, Challenges, Accomplishments</h2>
<p>The goal of our application was to achieve basic image processing / computer vision functions including but not limited to blur, sharpen, resizing, etc. At the moment we have achieved functions such as zoom, blur, and edge detection with more in progress. The biggest challenge to our development is understanding the processing algorithms. Java gives us a lot of tools to work with, but in order to parallelize the functions, we have to ignore some of the tools given to us to break down the algorithms. Our goal is to get a broad array of functions to display various and distinct features.</p><br>

<h3>Title</h3>
<p>Parallel Image Processing: An Efficient Method to Basic Computer Vision</p>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
 <ul>
   <li><p>Introduction: Image processing involves image input and the manipulation of pixels to achieve a desired outcome.</p></li>
   <li><p>Objective: Our project seeks a method that optimizes these processes through multithreading.</p></li>
   <li><p>Methodology: We will be taking standard level image processing functions and utilizing Java's executor service to parallelize these features. Discuss the form of parallelization we chose (pixel by pixel, row by row, split into regions, etc.)</p></li>
   <li><p>Results: Through our methods we have created a more streamlined approach to image processing with equal accuracy to the original algorithms.</p></li>
   <li><p>Conclusion: With further expansion to out application, we could include more complex features that may have lengthier runtimes that we could improve through our methods.</p></li>
