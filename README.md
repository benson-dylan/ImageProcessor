<h1>Parallel Image Processor</h1>
<p>Our project sought to create an application in Java that processes images with parallelized algorithms to increase efficiency</p>

<h2>Goals, Challenges, Accomplishments</h2>
<p>The goal of our application was to achieve basic image processing / computer vision functions including but not limited to blur, sharpen, resizing, etc. At the moment we have achieved functions such as zoom, blur, and edge detection with more in progress. The biggest challenge to our development is understanding the processing algorithms. Java gives us a lot of tools to work with, but in order to parallelize the functions, we have to ignore some of the tools given to us to break down the algorithms. Our goal is to get a broad array of functions to display various and distinct features.</p><br>
